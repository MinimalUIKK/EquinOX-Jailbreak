"Source code of an incomplete ios ~~8.4.1~~ 9.2 jailbreak."

Yalu for 9.2 by Andrew Augustine

Run the following command to download and try out the jailbreak on a Mac OS X system with XCODE. (I'm going to attempt to scavenge the xCode files and Executables, and tweak them so they can run on Windows. It'll be a while though.) 

```git clone https://github.com/August712/EquinOX-Jailbreak.git && cd EquinOX-Jailbreak.git && ./run.sh```
